# Knowledge Discovery in Text Corpora with DiffusionMaps and Information Theory

## Introduction

The  analysis  of  document  complexity  and  semantic  relationships  in  large  text  corporarequires  methods  that  can  capture  both  the  hierarchical  nature  of  knowledge  and  theasymmetric  dependencies  between  concepts.   Traditional  text  mining  approaches  treatdocument similarity as a symmetric problem, failing to model the fundamental asymme-tries inherent in knowledge representation and learning pathways.This  work  introduces  a  novel  framework  that  combines  information-theoretic  mea-sures with diffusion geometry to reveal the intrinsic complexity structure of documentcollections.  Our approach leverages cross-entropy kernels to capture asymmetric seman-tic relationships and SVD-based entropy measures to characterize document complexityalong a generality-specialization spectrum.
